Discord Bot FrameBot!

FrameBot is a discord bot that is made for use in the college station smash bros discord server. However, as it is open source, you may want to use this bot elsewhere.

There are a few things necessary in order to get this bot to work.
* The Discord and GraphQLClient libraries must be installed on your machine for the bot to function.
* A file called "token.dat" must be created in the py folder of the bot.
  * This file must contain ONLY the token for the bot.
  * The token can be generated at https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/
* A file called "ggtoken.dat" must be created in the py folder of the bot.
  * This file must contain ONLY the SmashGG authentification token.
  * The permissions to create the token can be found at https://developer.smash.gg/docs/authentication/
  * The bot will function without this token, but all SmashGG commands will be dissabled
  
Have fun!
