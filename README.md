Discord Bot FrameBot!

FrameBot is a discord bot that is made for use in the college station smash bros discord server. However, as it is open source, you may want to use this bot elsewhere.

There are a few things necessary in order to get this bot to work.
* Discord.py must be installed on your machine for the bot to function.
* A file called "token.dat" must be created in the py folder of the bot.
  * This file will be a file containing ONLY the token for the bot.
  
Have fun!
